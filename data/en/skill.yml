  subtitle : Active in Bridge of Allan
  content : "We believe in Scotland being the best it can be. We campaign tirelessly for a fairer, more just
      and democratic Scotland, in which our children thrive, businesses flourish, our youth receive a world class education,
      our elder members of society live with the dignity and respect they deserve and in which every man and woman can play
      their part in the worlds greatest small country.\n

      We have been active in Bridge of Allan since 1996 and thrive with a healthy membership
      and a strong core of activists who take part in both local and national campaigning.
      We were part of Yes Bridge of Allan and Yes Stirling during the 2014 Referendum and we
      keep the independence flame burning, ready for Indyref2. We were heavily involved in the recent
      General Election campaign, and were delighted to help our candidate,
      Alyn Smith, defeat the Tories and win a resounding victory."
