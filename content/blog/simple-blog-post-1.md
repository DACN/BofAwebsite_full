 Welcome to the website of the Bridge of Allan & Logie branch of the Scottish National Party. We believe in Scotland being the best it can be. We campaign tirelessly for a fairer, more just and democratic Scotland, in which our children thrive, businesses flourish, our youth receive a world class education, our elder members of society live with the dignity and respect they deserve and in which every man and woman can play their part in the worlds greatest small country.

 In more normal (non Covid) times, we often:

 * hold a regular Saturday morning stall outside the Westerton Arms;
 * distribute our Connect Newsletter in Bridge of Allan and Logie;
 * canvas for support; and
 * distribute our popular CALENDAR

 Despite COVID - we intend to publish our 2021 Calendar as usual.
