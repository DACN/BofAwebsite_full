Ukraine

Over the last week we have all watched in horror as events unfold in Ukraine. The unprovoked aggression by Russia and the suffering we are witnessing is unbelievable. Condemnation has been voiced by the rest of the world. I cannot imagine what the Ukrainian men, women and children are experiencing and feeling.

Today, (Thursday 3rd March), Stirling Council met where all political parties voiced their support and solidarity with Ukraine and the people. Cllr Scott Farmer, Leader of Council, gave a robust and moving speech.

You may have seen The National Wallace Monument lit up in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag, demonstrating Stirling’s support.

**If you wish to offer support, here are some contacts:**

Locally **Bridge of Allan Community Council and Bridge of Allan Parish Church** have galvanised to offer a comprehensive relief effort. Details can be found on Bridge of Allan Community Council Facebook page.
