Bridge of Allan & Logie SNP have delivered their New Year calendar around houses and businesses for over 20 years. This
year - as always - we have *printed* our calendar. However, because of the pandemic we believe it is not wise to
distribute material to peoples houses - which is why you have not received our calendar.

In the meantime, the next best thing is to download it and print it yourself. Hopefully on an A4 colour printer,
you will be able to download and print. Then fold in two,

Settings for print might vary, but try 'landscape' or 'best fit' it it doesn't come out well. We have provided it
in two formats
