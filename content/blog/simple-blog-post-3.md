Branch Meetings

Our branch meetings are on the second Monday of each month starting at 7.00pm. In normal times we meet in the GP room in the Allan Centre, Fountain Road, Bridge of Allan, FK9 4AT. In these COVID days, we are continuing our monthly meetings; at the same time on the second Monday of each month - but online with Zoom. If you would like to attend, please use the contact form below to find out the details from our secretary. Meetings last an hour to an hour and half.

Routine business is dealt with mainly by the Branch Executive, allowing meetings to focus more on political discussion around local and national issues. All views and opinions are welcomed and valued. Whenever possible we have guest speakers and/or elected members present, with talks followed by Q&A sessions.

Our meetings are informal and friendly and we warmly welcome new members. For those who want, thereâ€™s scope to be involved in policy making and campaigning and the opportunity to attend constituency meetings, assemblies and National Conferences either as a branch delegate or as a member visitor. However, those who simply wish to be card-carrying members to show their support for the Party are equally welcome.
